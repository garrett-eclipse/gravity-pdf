<p>When a form is submitted, or when using the <a href="#">Resend Notifications feature</a>, Gravity PDF generates and emails all PDF documents in a background process. Tasks that are "Processing" are being actively run in the background. Tasks that are "Pending" are in the queue, but the background process is not currently running. <a href="#">Read more about background processing in Gravity PDF</a>.</p>
